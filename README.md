# Allo Bank Frontend Technical Assignment

This project is built as part of the Allo Bank Frontend Technical Test.

A lightweight Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vuetify application that displays a list of SpaceX rockets, provides rocket details, and allows users to add custom rockets.
The app demonstrates clean architecture, state management, componentization, and UI state handling (loading, error, retry flow).

This application communicates with the SpaceX public API (https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/rockets) to retrieve a list of rockets and their details.

### Run Instruction

1.  Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2.  Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start at:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
